    "#### Taylor Swift is currently on her sixth concert tour (Summer 2023) and it has been a major topic of discussion across the United States. Her \"Eras Tour\" has been insanely successful early on and the NY Times projects that she might exceed $1 Billion in Sales which would break the all time record held by Elton John. Taylor recently performed in Kansas City and my social media accounts have been flooded with videos and images from friends of mine who attended the concerts. Since we could analyze anything we wanted in our final project, I decided to take a deeper look at the biggest story of the 2023 Summer. "
