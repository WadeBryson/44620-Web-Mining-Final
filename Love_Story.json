I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n[Chorus]\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'\"\n\n[Outro]\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you178Embed"
